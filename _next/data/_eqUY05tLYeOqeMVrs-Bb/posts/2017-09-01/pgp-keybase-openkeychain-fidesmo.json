The \"PGP\" in the title also resolves to it.\n- `GPG` / `gnupg`: GNU Privacy Guard, anothe encryption program that implementes OpenPGP.\n  - The `gpg` program shipped with most (if not all) Linuxes.\n\nGPG key:\n\nA format that contains _one_ main (cryptology) key, _one or more_ UserID (name + email), and zero or more _subkey_ (attached cryptology key).\n\n- [anotomy of a GPG key](https://davesteele.github.io/gpg/2014/09/20/anatomy-of-a-gpg-key/)\n  - The term 'key' is largely ambigious in a cryptology context. It can mean a number, a encoded form of that number, a file format of key (number) and other metadata, etc.\n  - A GPG key (file) is identified by fingerpoint (hashed public half of main key)\n  - This is not a immutable (thought it is).\n  - With secret half of the main key, one can modify the key and upload it to key servers.\n  - Key servers are mostly a key for _anyone_ to host keys. One should trust only keys that are confirmed by other way (e.g. meeting offline).\n- [intermediate GPG](https://davesteele.github.io/gpg/2015/08/01/intermediate-gpg/)\n- [Creating the perfect GPG keypair](https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/)\n- [How to change the expiration date of a GPG key](https://www.g-loaded.eu/2010/11/01/change-expiration-date-gpg-key/)\n\nSubkeys:\n\n- [Improve the Security of Your OpenPGP Key by Using Subkeys](http://www.connexer.com/articles/openpgp-subkeys)\n- [Import a subset of private subkeys in GPG](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/89328/import-a-subset-of-private-subkeys-in-gpg)\n- [Using OpenPGP subkeys in Debian development](https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys)\n\n## Keybase\n\n- A PGP key is almost necessary\n- One can have multiple PGP keys can be used\n- `keybase pgp update`: gpg keychain `->` keybase site\n- `keybase pgp export`: keybase fs -> local file (that can be imported to gpg)\n- `keybase pgp import`: local -> keybase fs\n\n- Feature: publish public key\n- Feature: gpg --list-keys\n\n## OpenKeychain\n\nBasically a PGP client for Android.\n\n## Fidesmo\n\nI found when used to keep PGP key, fidesmo card have a quite limited capacity:\n\n- Only keeps 1 key\n- I cannot save a existing key to it. i.e. A new key have to be created.\n- The secret key part is always stored within the card, and cannot be exported.\n  - It's intended to be an authoritive key holder, rather than a backup key store. Reasonable from a security POV.\n\n## My use of them\n\n- Passphrased copy, and\n- keep 1\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
