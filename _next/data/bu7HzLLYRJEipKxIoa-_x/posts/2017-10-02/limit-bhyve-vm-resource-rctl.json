Check whether RACCT / RCTL are built into FreeBSD kernel\n   - GENERIC kernel since FreeBSD 10.2 should already have this\n   - Can be found with `sysctl kern.racct.enable`\n   - See [this post](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/28871/) if you have to rebuild kernel for RACCT\n2. Enable RACCT by adding `kern.racct.enable=1` in loader.conf and reboot\n   - You should see `kern.racct.enable.1` in `sysctl kern.racct.enable` output\n3. Set resource limits with `rctl`. You can either use [options provided in vm-bhyve](https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve/blob/master/sample-templates/config.sample#L394-L406), or call rctl manually.\n   - [This PR](https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve/pull/63/files) shows the actual commands vm-bhyve uses.\n   - rctl can do much more than limiting CPU usage of a bhyve process, see [man rctl](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=rctl&sektion=8) for more rctl options\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
