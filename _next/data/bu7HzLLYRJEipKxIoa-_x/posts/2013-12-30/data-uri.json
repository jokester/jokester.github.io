ORK5CYII=)\n~~~\n\n#### Relevant posts\n\n[On Mobile, Data URIs are 6x Slower than Source Linking](http://www.mobify.com/blog/data-uris-are-slow-on-mobile/)\n\n- (binary) images as data URI are slow, especially for mobile clients\n- consider to use [CSS sprites](http://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/) instead\n\n[Data URI Performance: Don't Blame it on Base64](http://www.mobify.com/blog/base64-does-not-impact-data-uri-performance/)\n\n- SVG image can be included in data URI, either BASE64 encoded or not\n- encoded and not-encoded groups performed almost equally, and are still much slower than no-svg group\n- so BASE64 may not be the bottleneck\n- resource scheduling of data URIs is suspicious\n- examined with **real user monitoring** / **RUM**\n    - monitor real usage of actual user\n    - \"passive monitoring\"\n    - [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_user_monitoring)\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
