by Cary Millsap.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Axiomatic approach</p>
<ul>
<li>Trial-and-error approach of algebra:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>When solving <code>3x + 4 = 14</code>, try <code>x = 2</code>, <code>x = 3</code> and so on.</li>
<li>May work <strong>sometimes</strong>, yet still not a correct way for algebra.</li>
<li>Using it only indicates one is not thinking <strong>clearly</strong> about algebra.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Axiomatic approach of algebra (and other things):<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Each step should be documented (and proven), reliable and repeatable.</li>
<li>One small, logical, provable and auditable step at a time.</li>
<li>Such steps form a proof of thinking clearly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proving skill is vital<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>equally or more important than knowing</li>
<li>a must for good consultant / leader / employee</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of performance</p>
<ul>
<li><code>task</code>: a unit of work</li>
<li>measurements:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Response time: <code>#seconds per task</code></li>
<li>Throughput: <code>#tasks per second</code></li>
<li>Response and throughput must be measured separately<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>they are not necessarily reciprocals</li>
<li>one cannot derive response time only from throughput, vice versa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Percentile specification:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>e.g. &quot;95% of responses ended within 1s&quot;</li>
<li>maps better to the human experience than <em>mean</em> alone</li>
<li>captures both mean and variance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;Our customers fell the variance, not the mean.&quot; --- GE, six sigma</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diagnosis of performance</p>
<ul>
<li>The users&#x27; claim is often about the response time<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>simple form: &quot;It used to take only 1s&quot;</li>
<li>complex form: &quot;It&#x27;s so [...] slow&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First steps<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>State the problem clearly</li>
<li>Define the goal state<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>worse: when user does not understand a quantative goal</li>
<li>worse: when user&#x27;s expectation is impossible to meet</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tool: sequence diagram</li>
<li>Tool: profile<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>pitfall: skew<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>non-uniformity in a list of values</li>
<li>eliminate 1/2 calls may not eliminate 1/2 execution time</li>
<li>skew histogram: group calls with (range of time / counts / total time)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Estimations:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>cost</li>
<li>return<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Amdahl&#x27;s law: performance improvement is proportional to how much a program uses the improved thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>political capital: credibility in group</li>
<li>reliability of estimations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efficiency</p>
<ul>
<li>inverse measure of waste<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>waste: how much of service time can be eliminated<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>without adding capacity</li>
<li>without sacrificing function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>do not adjust the program to accommodate inefficient programs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Load</p>
<ul>
<li>Competition for resource induced by tasks</li>
<li>The reason that performance testing does not catch all problems in production</li>
<li>measurement: utilization (usage / capacity)</li>
<li>High load increases response time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacts of Load</p>
<ul>
<li>Queueing delay<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>delay due to waiting</li>
<li>can be modelled by &quot;M/M/m&quot; model<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>ideal scalable queue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>total = service time + queueing delay</li>
<li>high throughput and fast response are conflicting<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>knee: optimal load</li>
<li>min ( response time / utilization )</li>
<li>the actual knee of an M/M/m system is listed in table (page 10 of the paper)</li>
<li>when load is below knee: (marginal response time) is low.</li>
<li>when load is beyond the knee: high (marginal response time), system become unusable quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Coherency delay<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>delay due to shared resource</li>
<li>cannot be modelled with &quot;M/M/m&quot; model</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing</p>
<ul>
<li>may not catch all problems, still necessary</li>
<li>keep balance between &quot;no test&quot; and &quot;complete emulation of production&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measuring for optimization</p>
<ul>
<li>Throughtput: easier to measure</li>
<li>Response time: happens at client side, and is harder to measure</li>
<li>People tend to measure what&#x27;s easy to measure</li>
<li>Surrogate measures:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>are easy to measure</li>
<li>may work <strong>sometimes</strong></li>
<li>know their limitation and use them wisely</li>
<li>e.g. subroutine call counts, samples (i.e. not all) of subroutine execution durations</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other principles</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk less in optimizing: when everybody is fine, do not adjust the world for one program</li>
<li>Performance is a feature</li>
<li>Real performance is unrevealed until the production phase</li>
<li>Write the program so that it&#x27;s easy to fix in production</li>
</ul>
</li>
