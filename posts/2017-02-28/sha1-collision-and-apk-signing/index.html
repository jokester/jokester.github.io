<p>After investigating it a bit, I am writing this as a FAQ to answer myself.</p>
<p>If you need more information, or want to share any ideas, feel free to drop me a comment.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Why should I be concerned?</h1>
<p>SHA1 was used by default in APK signing for a few years.
You might be using it as either creator or consumer of APK files.</p>
<h1>What is the worst case?</h1>
<p>A bad guy <em>may</em> be able to create a APK with his/her malicious code, and identical SHA1 digest of your genuine files. Devices that had previous version will consider the crafted APK to be signed by <em>your</em> certificate, and issue no warning when installing it.</p>
<h1>Am I still (practically) safe?</h1>
<p>IMHO the answer is still yes in early 2017.</p>
<p>In the light side of the world, there are factors that may make actual attack difficult and unprofitable.</p>
<ul>
<li>A collision is still expensive to find.</li>
<li>It may be more difficult to find collision for executable files like <code>.dex</code>.</li>
<li>APK may not be validated with SHA1 (see the following part).</li>
<li>A sane user may not install APK from untrusted origin (given that your Play Console account is not compromised).</li>
</ul>
<p>And this is the dark side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theoretically there is danger.</li>
<li>Things can change.</li>
<li>Android versions before 7.0 (N / SDK 24) , that have no great Signature schama v2, are inherently insecure due to downgrade attack.</li>
</ul>
<h1>How is SHA1 used in APK signing?</h1>
<p>SHA1 and its fellows is used in the <code>digest</code> part of <code>digest-and-sign</code> pattern of <em>digital signature</em>.</p>
<p>The digest function (MD5 / SHA1 / SHA256) and type of sign key (DSA / RSA / EC) constitutes a <em>Signature Algorithm</em> like <code>SHA1withRSA</code> or <code>SHA256withEC</code>.</p>
<h2>APK Signature scheme v1</h2>
<p>Scheme v1 had a few other algorithms, but I&#x27;m afraid a vast majority used <code>SHA1withRSA</code>, it have been default of several tools.</p>
<h2>APK Signature scheme v2</h2>
<p>Scheme v2 always use SHA2 and up, and is thus safe against SHA1 collision.</p>
<p><em>But</em> it is only supported since Android 7.0 (SDK level 24).</p>
<h1>How is digest function determined for scheme V1?</h1>
<h2><code>APKsign</code></h2>
<p>This is the up-to-date sign tool since Android build-tools v24.
<code>APKsign</code> determines digest algorithm from key type and minimum SDK version of APK,
so as to use SHA256 when possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>SHA256withRSA</code> for minimum SDK 18 (Android 4.3) and up</li>
<li><code>SHA256withDSA</code> for minimum SDK 21 (Android 5.0) and up</li>
<li><code>SHA256withEC</code> for minimum SDK 18 and up</li>
<li><code>SHA1with*</code> for lower minimum SDK levels</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact code can be found in <code>V1SchemeSigner.java</code> <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/tools/apksig/">here</a>.</p>
<h2><code>jarsigner</code></h2>
<p>This is the outdated tool used before Android build-tools v24. It is distributed as a part of <code>JDK</code>. Android build tools uses it with <code>SHA1with*</code> by default.</p>
<h1>Can I use both SHA1 and SHA256 in one APK?</h1>
<p>No.</p>
<p>An APK that contain more than 1 signature will be rejected by Google Play.</p>
<p>(similar thing can be done with <code>jar</code>, but google decided to reject such APKs)</p>
<h1>Can I switch to SHA2?</h1>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>This can be done by setting minimum SDK to a higher value.
However older devices will not be able to install your new APKs.</p>
<p>Please go on and read <em>why a simply switching is not enough</em>.</p>
<h1>Is switching to SHA2 (completely) enough?</h1>
<p>No.</p>
<p><em>/me sobs</em></p>
<p>In a few devices I tested, Android installs new APK without warning, as long as it is signed with identical certificate of existing version.</p>
<p>This means older devices (that only checks scheme v1) is inherently vulenarble to a <em>downgrade attack</em>.
One can overwrite a <code>SHA256withRSA</code>-signed version with a <code>SHA1withRSA</code> APK (maybe made from an old version).</p>
<h1>What can I do to maximize security?</h1>
<p>Sign with SHA2, preferably with a new certificate that have not been used with SHA1.</p>
<p>(We can publish separated APKs for Android 18 and up, see <a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html">multiple-APKs</a>)</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"mdMeta":{"realpath":"/home/runner/work/jokester.github.io/jokester.github.io/posts/2017/2017-02-28-sha1-collision-and-apk-signing.md","slug":["2017-02-28","sha1-collision-and-apk-signing"],"frontMatter":{"title":"SHA1 Collision and Android APK Signing","publishAt":"2017-02-28"}},"mdContent":"\nAs a paranoiac Android developer, I was concerned by recent SHA1-collision news.\n\nAfter investigating it a bit, I am writing this as a FAQ to answer myself.\n\nIf you need more information, or want to share any ideas, feel free to drop me a comment.\n\n- toc\n  {:toc}\n\n# Why should I be concerned?\n\nSHA1 was used by default in APK signing for a few years.\nYou might be using it as either creator or consumer of APK files.\n\n# What is the worst case?\n\nA bad guy _may_ be able to create a APK with his/her malicious code, and identical SHA1 digest of your genuine files.
